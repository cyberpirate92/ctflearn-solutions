# CTFLearn 01 - Basic Injection

Usually such input & fetch uses a SQL statement something like
 
`SELECT * FROM table WHERE column=‘value’`

When `Luke` is given as input, we get a record with some information

So the following SQL is being executed

`SELECT * FROM table WHERE column=‘Luke’`

Our goal is to modify this query to return all the records, but we can only modify the query after the WHERE `column=‘`  part

One way to do that is to write a query like this

`SELECT * FROM table WHERE column=‘’ OR ‘’=‘’`

Solution: Type  `’ or ‘’=‘` in the input box to get all the records.
