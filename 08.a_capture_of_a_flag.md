# CTFLearn 08 - A CAPture of a flag
## Problem Description
This isn’t what I had in mind, when I asked someone to capture a flag… can you help? You should check out WireShark. https://mega.nz/#!3WhAWKwR!1T9cw2srN2CeOQWeuCm0ZVXgwk-E2v-TrPsZ4HUQ_f4

## Solution
I tried to see if the flag is within any of the packets so I performed a few searches using regex patterns, but no luck there. 

Then I noticed that most of the http traffic is from/to private IP addresses (10.x.x.x), except for a few (fontawesome, some CDN sites etc), one of them is a request to 
`http://www.hazzy.co.uk/?msg=ZmxhZ3tBRmxhZ0luUENBUH0=` . 

I opened it in the browser and it was a directory listing, so what’s with the query parameter `msg` ? I tried changing the value and saw no changes, it seems that this param probably has no effect on the page and looks like a base64 encoded string (the `=` at the end and the lack of special characters). 

Decoding the text gives the flag we have been looking for.

```python
import base64
# The value of the msg query param
text = ‘ZmxhZ3tBRmxhZ0luUENBUH0=’
print(base64.b64decode(text)) # b'flag{AFlagInPCAP}'
```
