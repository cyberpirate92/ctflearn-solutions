# CTFLearn 06 - Character Encoding
## Problem Statement
In the computing industry, standards are established to facilitate information interchanges among American coders. Unfortunately, Iâ€™ve made communication a little bit more difficult. Can you figure this one out? 41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D

## Solution
The given value is in hex, just need to convert it to ascii and translate it to the actual characters
```python
hex_string = '41 42 43 54 46 7B 34 35 43 31 31 5F 31 35 5F 55 35 33 46 55 4C 7D';

print(''.join([chr(int(x, 16)) for x in hex_string.split(' ')]));  # ABCTF{45C11_15_U53FUL}
```
