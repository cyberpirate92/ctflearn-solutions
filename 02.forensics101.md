## Problem Statement
Think the flag is somewhere in there. Would you help me find it? https://mega.nz/#!OHohCbTa!wbg60PARf4u6E6juuvK9-aDRe_bgEL937VO01EImM7c


## Solution

The file is an image, we can use `strings` utility in linux/Mac to list strings in files.

Use `strings {filename}` in the terminal and in the list of strings, the following string can be found which is the flag weâ€™re looking for.

`flag{wow!_data_is_cool}`
